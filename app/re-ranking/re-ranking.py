        main purpose : 
        Search finds the relevant candidates → Reranking puts the best candidates first 
        → The LLM uses the top results to generate a better answer.

        The main purpose of rerank() is to reorder the retrieved candidate documents based on how
        semantically similar they are to the user's query, so that the most relevant documents appear at the top.
